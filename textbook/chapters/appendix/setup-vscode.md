# Set up Visual Studio Code

There are two approaches to creating, compiling and running C programs you will write. The first approach is to use a separate tool to perform each of these actions --- a text editor to create the program file, a compile command to compile it, and another command to run it. The second approach is to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which allows you to perform many tasks from a single, usually graphical, application.

VS Code is the most popular IDE among developers in 2023[^1]. 

## For Windows Users

You can follow along the following video for steps on setting up VS Code on Windows. Brief steps are also provided below.

**[Step 1]** Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and download VS Code. It will take seconds.

**[Step 2]** Click on the downloaded file to open it. Accept the agreement, and press Next and Install when appropriate. Make sure to tick **Create a Desktop icon**. It takes a few more seconds. Then press Finish.

**[Step 3]** Follow the following steps taken from steps 1 to 6 in [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/).
        
1. Download the installer by clicking [msys2.exe](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2023-10-26/msys2-x86_64-20231026.exe)
2. Run/double click on the downloaded file
3. When asked about the installer folder, choose `C:\msys64`
4. When done, make sure "Run MSYS2 now" is selected and click "Finish"
5. In the black window that pops, type in `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc`, and press "Enter"
6. Press "Enter" again to proceed with installation.


**[Step 4]** Additionally, you need to run the following command in the same MSYS2 UCRT64 terminal. This is taken from step 5 in [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw).

```{code-block} bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
```

Press "Enter" to accept the default option. This will take a few minutes.

**[Step 5]** In the MSYS2 UCRT64 terminal, type in the following commands to make sure the compiler and debugger are installed. If you do not see something similar to the expected output, do not proceed. Either repeat the steps or seek help.

*Command 1*

```{code-block} bash
gcc --version
```

*Expected output*

```{code-block} bash
gcc.exe (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0
```

*Command 2*

```{code-block} bash
gdb --version
```

*Expected output*

```{code-block} bash
GNU gdb (GDB) 13.2
```

*Command 3*

```{code-block} bash
g++ --version
```

*Expected output*

```{code-block} bash
g++.exe (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0
```

**[Step 6]** Go to **Settings** using the search at the bottom left. In {\bf Find a setting}, search for "Edit environment variables for your account". Click on **Path**, and click **Edit**. In the new window, press **New** on the right and add `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` and click **OK**.

```{figure} ./images/environment-variable.png
:alt: Edit Path
:width: 800px
:align: center

Edit Path
```    

**[Step 7]** Open/Launch *Visual Studio Code*.

## For Mac/Linux Users

You can follow along the following video for steps on setting up VS Code on Mac/Linux. Brief steps are also provided below.

{{ video_embed | replace("%%VID%%", "pbPgkOYireQ")}}

**[Step 1]** Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and download VS Code. It will take seconds. 

**[Step 2]** Once the download is complete, open the zip file downloaded by double-clicking the .zip file. It will extract the zip file and install the application. Drag and drop the produced Visual Studio Code Application into the Applications folder. 

**[Step 3]** Before being able to compile, run and debug your program, we need to install the necessary C compiler and debugger. To do so, click on **Spotlight Search**, type and select **Terminal**. 

**[Step 4]** Type in the following command in the terminal:

```
$ xcode-select --install
```

Please note `$` is not part of the command. It may appear as `%` instead on terminal.

Click "Agree" if you are prompted to agree on a license. Installation will take time depending on your machine's capacity and Internet connection. It took me $5$ -- $6$ minutes. 

**[Step 5]** Check if your C compiler has been correctly installed by typing: 

```
$ gcc --version
```
, to see version number of gcc.

If it is not installed, you will see 
```{code-block} bash
gcc: Command not found
```

**[Step 6]** Open/Launch *Visual Studio Code*.

## Using VS Code

**[Step 1]** To create a new folder, click on **Explorer** $\rightarrow$ **Open Folder**. Navigate to your desired folder $\rightarrow$ press **New Folder**. Name your folder `aps105-labs` and click **Create** $\rightarrow$ **Open**. Make sure your desired folder that contains `aps105-labs` does not contain any spaces in its path. 

**[Step 2]** Create a new folder in the `aps105-labs` folder, for example `lab0`, by clicking on **New Folder** icon next to `aps105-labs` on the top left.


**[Step 3]** Click on `lab0`, and press the **New File** icon next to `aps105-labs` to create a new file. 

**[Step 4]** To compile using VS Code, we need to install two necessary extensions. Go to Extensions below the Explorer icon. 

**[Step 5]** Install **C/C++** and **C/C++ Runner** extensions by clicking on ``Install'' after you click on each of them.

**[Step 6]** On the bottom left of your window, you should see **Select Folder**. This helps you select a particular working folder. In our case, we want to select `aps105-labs/lab0`.

**[Step 7]** Write a test code in `lab0.c` file. Turn on the option of **Autosave**, so that you do not need to worry about saving your C program every time you make a change. Go to **File** $\rightarrow$ **Autosave**.

**[Step 8]** To compile your program, press the *Compile* button towards the bottom left of the screen. To run your program, press the *Run* button. Any output will be observed in the terminal to the lower half of your VS Code window.

**[Step 9]** Consistent code is easy to read. Consistency appears in the proper indentation, spacing and appropriate line length. To automatically ensure your code is consistent, you can use the default formatter in VS Code. To do so, go to **Settings** by clicking on the gear at the bottom left of VS Code window. In the search bar, type "formatter". Check the **Editor: Default Formatter** is set to **None**, and **Editor: Format on Save** is ticked. This will automatically format your code every time you save. In addition, in the search bar, type "format" and under **Extensions** $\rightarrow$ **C/C++**, set the **C\_{Cpp}: {Clang}\_{format}\_{fallback} Style** to **Google**. 

This will ensure that your code is formatted according to the Google C++ Style Guide.

**[Step 10]** Walking through individual lines of your code step by step is called debugging. To debug your code, you need to add a breakpoint. A breakpoint is a line of code where your program will pause at when you click the *Debug* button at the bottom left next to Compile and Run buttons. To create a breakpoint, you need to hover over the line you want your code to pause at and click there.

**[Step 11]** Click on the **Debug** button to start a debugging session. Your code will stop at your breakpoint without executing it, unless you press **Step over** button. As you step over, you will execute further lines and observe variable values changing on the left. If you want to continue running the program, without debugging further, you can press the **Continue** button.
