# Testing Exercises

Many of these exercises are taken from past exams of APS105 Computer Fundamentals courses at University of Toronto. The solutions are provided in the answer boxes.

Headings in this page classify the exercises into different categories: **[Easy]**, **[Intermediate]**, and **[Challenging]**. I suggest you start by easy exercises and work your way up to the challenging ones.
