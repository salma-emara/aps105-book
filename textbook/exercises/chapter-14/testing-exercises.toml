question = '''
The following array of integers is the result of the first round of partitioning, used 
in the Quicksort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order. Identify the possible 
array element or elements that could have been used as the pivot in the first partitioning 
round. Justify your answer; guessing an answer with no justifications will result in a 
mark of zero. 

```{code-block} c
{15, 6, 45, 60, 32, 71, 102, 81}
```
'''
answer = ''' 
The pivot is 71, because all elements on its left are smaller than it 
`{15, 6, 45, 60, 32}`, and all elements on its right are larger then 
it `{102, 81}`.

We have a number of TAs who have carefully marked a large number of final exams and

[PLEASE NOTE that this question is not worth many marks, so answer with a phrase!
 Do not spend time elaborating.]

(a) Here are some sorting methods you know about. Which ones would work well,
and which not well to allow the TAs to most quickly sort the exams? Why or why 
not would the particular method work well or not?

Insertion Sort: Does not work well, All TAs have to work on looking for one element to place it at the end
Selection Sort: Does not work well, All TAs have to work on looking for one element to place it at the end
Bubble Sort: Does not work well, All TAs have to work on looking for one element to place it at the end
Quicksort: Works well, Each TA can work on groups of exams

What may be a better sorting method?

answer = '''
Each TA takes a stack of exams and sorts into alphabetic piles which are then sorted.
