How many errors are there in the code?\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\ndouble howMuchToPay(int, int, double);\n\nint main(void) {\n    int number;\n    double unitPrice, discount;\n    printf(\"Please enter the number of notebooks you want to buy,\n     the price per notebook and the student discount: \");\n   scanf(\"%d %lf %lf\", &number, &unitPrice, &discount);\n   printf(\"The total price is %d\\n\", howMuchToPay(number, unitPrice));\n   return 0;\n}\n\ndouble howMuchToPay(int number, double unitPrice, double discount) {\n    if (discount <= 0) {\n        discount = 0.0;  // when discount is 0 or negative,\n         it is set to 0.0 (no discount)\n    }\n    double price = number * unitPrice * (1 - discount);\n    return price;\n}\n```\n",

        "A is incorrect. There are 3 errors in the code.\nError 1:\nThe 3rd line, in the declaration of the function `howMuchToPay`, the second parameter should be `double` instead of `int` according to the sample input. It needs to match the type of the 2nd argument in the implementation of the function.\n\nError 2:\nThe 10th line, the return type of the function `howMuchToPay` is `double`, but the `printf` statement in the `main` function is using `%d` to print the return value of the function. It should be `%.2lf` instead.\n\nError 3:\nThe 10th line, the function `howMuchToPay` is called with 2 arguments, but the function declaration and implementation both require 3 arguments. The 3rd argument is missing. Even though the 3rd argument could be 0, it is still required.\n",
